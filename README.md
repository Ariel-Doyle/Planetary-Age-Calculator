# _Planetary Calculator_

#### By _**Ariel Doyle**_

#### _This is the business logic for an application as practice for writing code, working with HTML, CSS, Web APIs, Test Driven Development, JavaScript looping and arrays, JavaScript classes, and object-oriented JavaScript._

## Technologies Used

- _HTML_
- _VS Code Editor_
- _CSS_
- _JavaScript_
- _Jest_
- _eslint_
- _babel_
- _webpack_
- _node package manager(npm)_
- _JSON_
- _Web APIs_

## Description

_This application allows a user to enter their age and will return that age in solar revolutions on each planet (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). Additionally, a user can enter a past or future age to determine how many planetary revolutions have passed or have yet to pass to that age._

_This is JavaScript business logic as practice for writing code in line with lessons taught by [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com). This logic can serve as the framework for starting your own code writing journey as regards working with basic object-oriented JavaScript, JavaScript classes, JSON, and Web APIs. If you would like to follow in these lessons, please visit [Learn How To Program](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript-part-time)._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- _You will require Node.js version 16.14.0 as well as node package manager (npm) version 8.3.1 in order to be compatible with the pinned versions of webpack, eslint, babel, and others. Please see [Learn How To Program: Installing node.js](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/setting-up-javascript/installing-node-js) and [Learn How To Program: Test Driven Development, Lessons 1-20](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript-part-time/test-driven-development/test-driven-development-and-environments-with-javascript-objectives) for install information and walk-through._
